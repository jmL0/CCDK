<p>The following example starts a game instance for the ssw_debug startup configuration in the SSW project. The game instance will be executed with user &quot;user47&quot;, game port 60001 and video port 60000.</p>
<pre><code>shinra.py run SSW ssw_debug user47 60001 60000
</code></pre>
<p>Note the client has to be executed with a matching port configuration to be able to connect (<a href="#ShinraClient">see &quot;Shinra Client&quot; for more information</a>).</p>
<h3>Setup command</h3>
<p>The setup command allows to perform all the necessary steps to prepare the execution of a Shinra game instance (similar to what run command does), without performing the actual game execution. It is useful in cases where you need full control on the game execution, like running the game in a debugger environment. The setup command will extract the user data where MCS expects it to be, and create a cloud property file with the proper configuration values. As you are responsible for the game execution you need to consider a few aspects usually handled automatically by MCS:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be able to run multiple instances of the same game you will need to specify a different property filename for each instance with -cloud-properties option. See <a href="#MultipleGames">Multiple game instances section</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Make sure to use the proper command line parameters for the game itself.</li>
<li>Note the client has to be executed with a matching port configuration to be able to connect (<a href="#ShinraClient">see &quot;Shinra Client&quot; for more information</a>).</li>
<li>After a game execution, you are responsible to call the cleanup command (see <a href="#CleanupCommand">&quot;Cleanup command&quot;</a> section below).</li>

<p>Note any additional property in the json object will be ignored by MCS.</p>
<h2><a name="ShinraClient"></a> Shinra Client</h2>
<p>ShinraClient.exe can be found in the MCS installation directory under &lt;MCS_INSTALL&gt;/Shinra/x32/Release/ShinraClient.exe.
It is the client application in charge of interacting with the player. It displays the
game video, plays the game audio and sends the player inputs to the game server.
You can manually run the ShinraClient to connect to a game instance running on a distant computer. When connecting to an existing game instance, make sure you specify the proper server IP, game port and video port.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>-t : Server IP or host-name of the game server.</li>
<li>-pv : Video Port</li>
<li>-pg : Game Port</li>
</ul>
<p>Following is an example connecting to a game instance running on the local computer, using game port 60001 and video port 60000.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;MCS_INSTALL&gt;/Shinra/x32/Release/ShinraClient.exe -t 127.0.0.1 -pg 60001 -pv 60000
</code></pre>
<h3>How to play remotely</h3>
<p>You can execute the client application on a separate computer where the game instance is running. Just unpack the MCS package in the remote computer, then edit the StartShinraClient.bat to point to the IP address where you run the game, and set the game port and video port to match those defined for the corresponding game instance you want to connect to. You can then start the Shinra Client and connect to your game.</p>
<h2><a name="ShinraProject"></a> Shinra project file format</h2>
<p>Shinra projects are json text files containing the necessary information for:</p>
<ul>
<li>packaging and deployment of game data (dataPacks),</li>
<li>execution and configuration of the game (startups).</li>
</ul>
<p>The SDS interface is the preferred way to create and edit project files. But the project structure is simple enough so you can manually edit it. The following is an example of a simple configuration with one datapack, and one startup configuration.</p>

</ul>
<h2><a name="StartupArgs"></a> Startup arguments</h2>
<p>The arguments field of a startup configuration can contain some special variable that will be automatically replaced when running the game instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>{UserId} : will be replaced by the id of the user running the game instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following is a simple example of command line including {UserId}.</p>
<pre><code>--debug --username={UserId} --dbhost=192.137.16.50 --rthost=192.137.16.50
</code></pre>
<p>When a new game instance is executed using shinra.py script (<a href="#RunCommand">see &quot;Run command&quot;</a>), the id of the user is replaced in place just before executing the game instance for this user.</p>
<pre><code>--debug --username=user47 --dbhost=192.137.16.50 --rthost=192.137.16.50
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="CustomProperties"></a> Custom properties</h2>
<p>The CustomProperties field of a startup configuration is used to force some settings in the CloudProperties.json configuration file. You can find more about the format and the content of the CloudProperties file in the <a href="#CloudProperties">&quot;CloudProperties configuration file&quot;</a> section.</p>
<p>The following example will overwrite the property Cloud.Debug.BreakOnStartup to True, and Cloud.Local.EncoderThreads to 3. Note the property names are case sensitive.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;CustomProperties&quot;: {
  &quot;Debug.BreakOnStartup&quot;: True,
  &quot;Local.EncoderThreads&quot;: 3,
}
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="FileHooks"></a> File hooks</h2>
<p>Shinra projects enable to define File Hooks for games. These File hooks are used to redirect the file-system access of the game application to a different place. This redirection is completely transparent to the game application. The main goal of these file access redirections is to enable running two instances of the same game with the same Windows user on the same machine, and avoid file conflicts when those different instances try to access the user's data.
The file hook redirection depends on the Shinra UserID and the GameID to make sure each instance is isolated from the other.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of file hook redirection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temp hooks: files redirected by these hooks will be discarded when the game is over. These hooks are only to work-around multiple instances accessing the same data.</li>
<li>Cloud save hooks: files redirected by these hooks will be saved when the game is over, and restored at the next game execution for the same user. See <a href="#CloudSave">&quot;Cloud save files&quot;</a> section for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a particular file path is matched by both Temp and Cloud file hooks, the Temp hooks have priority so the file won't be saved.</p>
<h3>File hook syntax</h3>
<p>A File hook is defined by a pattern used to match the path of the files accessed by the application. To define a pattern, you have access to some predefined variables and wildcard operators.</p>
<p>Predefined variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;USERID&gt; : The Shinra UserID as specified when starting the game instance.</li>
<li>&lt;EXEPATH&gt; : Path where the game executable is running.</li>
<li>&lt;USERNAME&gt; : Windows user name.</li>
<li>&lt;Profile&gt; : Windows profile folder for the current user.</li>
<li>&lt;Documents&gt; : Windows Document folder for the current user.</li>
<li>&lt;LocalAppData&gt; : Windows AppData/Local folder for the current user.</li>
<li>&lt;LocalAppDataLow&gt; : Windows AppData/LocalLow folder for the current user.</li>
<li>&lt;RoamingAppData&gt; : Windows AppData/Roaming folder for the current user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wildcard operators:</p>
<ul>
<li>some/path/* : Simple star * matches all the files directly under some/path, but none of the sub-directories.</li>
<li>some/path/** : Double star ** matches all the files under some/path, and all its sub-directories.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following example will match all the files under &quot;C:\Users\user47\AppData\Roaming\Eidos Montreal&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;RoamingAppData&gt;\Eidos Montreal\**
</code></pre>
<h3>File hook redirection</h3>
<p>When the application tries to access a file that matches a file hook, this file access will be redirected to a different path. This new path will depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>StorePath variable defined in the MCS settings.</li>
<li>UserID used to start the game instance</li>
<li>GameID used to start the game instance</li>
<li>Type of the hook (Temp or Cloud)</li>
</ul>
<p>The file will be redirected to:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;StorePath&gt;/UserFiles/&lt;UserID&gt;/&lt;GameID&gt;/&lt;Type&gt;/
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="CloudSave"></a> Cloud save files</h3>
<p>Between to executions of a game instance, the user's data for a particular game is stored in a tar.gz archive. This archive is stored in a directory depending on:</p>
<ul>
<li>ArchivePath variable defined in the MCS settings</li>
<li>UserID used to start the game instance</li>
<li>GameID used to start the game instance</li>
</ul>
<p>The save data for a particular user will be:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ArchivePath&gt;/&lt;UserID&gt;/&lt;GameID&gt;.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="RegistryRedirection"></a> Registry redirection</h2>
<p>Just like FileHooks are way to avoid multiple Shinra users performing conflicting
file accesses, the Registry redirection is there to avoid multiple Shinra users to
perform conflicting registry key accesses. All the access to the registry keys in
HKEY_CURRENT_USER will be redirected in a local registry hive. This local registry
hive will be saved and restored the save way as the <a href="#CloudSave">Cloud save files</a>.
The Registry redirection is automatic and does not require additional configuration.</p>
<h2><a name="CloudProperties"></a>CloudProperties configuration file</h2>
<p>MCS games are reading their configuration from a CloudProperties.json file. When running a game with the shinra.py script, a CloudProperties file is automatically created for each the new instance, and cleaned-up on game termination. When running game manually with the setup command you have the opportunity to directory edit the CloudProperties.json file before running the game.</p>
<h3><a name="MultipleGames"></a> Multiple game instances</h3>
<p>The default behaviour for MCS is to read the properties from a file named &quot;CloudProperties.json&quot; next to the executable file. As a result you can only have one game instance of the game using this method. To run multiple instances, you need to create multiple cloud properties files, each specifying its own set of game port, video port and user id.
When running a game you can set the FLARE_CONFIG environment variable to specify which property file to use. Here is an example running DX3 using the MyCloudProperties.json configuration file.</p>
<pre><code>set FLARE_CONFIG=MyCloudProperties.json
DX3.exe -archive
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="Properties"></a> Properties options</h3>
<p>The CloudProperties.json generated by shinra.py script can be edited if you need to test different settings. Some options inside it can be changed to provide a better experience. The properties are presented with the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>Cloud.Section.Name: default
</code></pre>
<p>which correspond to the following <a href="http://json.org">JSON</a> property:</p>
<pre><code>{ &quot;Cloud&quot;: { &quot;Section&quot;: { &quot;Name&quot;: default } } }
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cloud.Performance.MaxFPS: 30</p>
<p>The maximum number of frames requests per second, after which the game start to be throttled down by pausing in the render thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud.Session.TokenTimeoutSec: 120</p>
<p>The maximum number of seconds before the game stop accepting new connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud.Local.EncoderThreads: 1</p>
<p>The number of threads dedicated to encoding the video stream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud.Local.MaxRenderingFrames: 3</p>
<p>The maximum number of queued rendering frame requested before the game start to block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud.Local.MaxEncodingFrames: 5</p>
<p>The maximum number of queued encoding frame requested before the game start to block.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a name="FAQ1"></a>Is MCS the same as Shinra Remote Rendering technology ?</p>
<p>Shinra MCS used the same abstraction of the Direct X API to generate the rendering commands on Shinra Remote Renderer.  The implementation is however independent and simplified, and does not include many hardware acceleration and optimizations allowing Shinra Remote Renderer to scale to many clients on a single server.  It's also used a simple JPEG encoder instead of Shinra optimized encoder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="FAQ2"></a>My game is slower when I used Shinra MCS... will it be also the case with the Shinra Remote Renderer ?</p>
<p>As said in <a href="#FAQ1">question 1</a>, Shinra MCS is an independant implementation of the Shinra Remote Renderer technology. It uses no hardware acceleration, can't share any resources from other clients and uses a software-only encoder delivering a bigger video stream.  It's also use the same resources as the client itself (it run in the same process) which can slow down your game further.  Briefly, Shinra MCS just try to imitate the Remote Rendering experience but aren't intend as a benchmark for the kind of performance you can get from Shinra Remote Rendering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="FAQ3"></a>Which port is used by MCS ?</p>
<p>Shinra MCS used the following ports by default (with the <a href="#CloudProperties">CloudProperties</a> name in parenthesis) :</p>
<ul>
<li>Video Port (<code>Cloud.Network.VideoPort</code>): 60000</li>
<li>Audio/Game Port (<code>Cloud.Network.GamePort</code>): 60001</li>
</ul>
<p>You can change which ports the ShinraMCS <code>-pv</code> and <code>-pg</code> (respectively for video and game port) options like this:</p>
<pre><code>ShinraClient -t localhost -pv 70000 -pg 70001
</code></pre>
